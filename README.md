<h1>Radical Recipes!</h1>
<h2>A new passion project</h2>

<h3>Goals: </h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a full stack app, brushing up on my backend knowledge and CRUD capabilities in particular.</li>
<li>Implement a user management system on the admin side to store and intract with a UI instead of going through the database.</li>
<li>Have a system of recipe storage and accesibility, of text, images, and videos that is simple to use and easy to access.</li>
<li>Avoid the BS that is modern recipe webpages by creating a web app that allows for a clear instructions without a long backstory, have related videos and images to aid in the kitchen and not in advertising.</li>
</ol>
